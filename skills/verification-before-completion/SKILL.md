# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency.

**Core principle:** Evidence before claims, always.

**Violating the letter of this rule is violating the spirit of this rule.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## The Gate Function

```
BEFORE claiming any status or expressing satisfaction:

1. IDENTIFY: What command proves this claim?
2. RUN: Execute the FULL command (fresh, complete)
3. READ: Full output, check exit code, count failures
4. VERIFY: Does output confirm the claim?
   - If NO: State actual status with evidence
   - If YES: State claim WITH evidence
5. ONLY THEN: Make the claim
6. CLOSE: If this verification gates a bead closure, run `bd close <id> --reason "description with evidence from step 4"`

Skip any step = lying, not verifying
```

## Common Failures

| Claim | Requires | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Tests pass | Test command output: 0 failures | Previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output: 0 errors | Partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command: exit 0 | Linter passing, logs look good |
| Bug fixed | Test original symptom: passes | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Red-green cycle verified | Test passes once |
| Agent completed | VCS diff shows changes | Agent reports "success" |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line checklist | Tests passing |
| No security regression | SAST/audit tool if one exists (semgrep, bandit, npm/pip audit) → 0 new findings, AND diff review: no control weakened/removed/bypassed, no new sink. No tool? Use the "If Verification Cannot Run" path: record the manual diff-review as evidence, note no SAST available. | Tests pass (tests rarely cover security) |

## If Verification Cannot Run

When no verification command exists (no test suite, CI down, external dependency unavailable):

1. **Record the gap:** `bd note <id> "verification blocked: <reason>"`
2. **Create a blocker:** `bd create "Set up verification for <feature>" -t task` and `bd dep add <current-task> <new-task>`
3. **Document partial verification:** Note what WAS verifiable (e.g., "linter passes, manual smoke test done, but no automated test suite exists")
4. **Never silently skip:** A bead closed without verification evidence AND without a documented gap is worse than a bead left open

## Red Flags - STOP

- Using "should", "probably", "seems to"
- Expressing satisfaction before verification ("Great!", "Perfect!", "Done!", etc.)
- About to commit/push/PR without verification
- Trusting agent success reports
- Relying on partial verification
- Thinking "just this once"
- About to claim done while a requirement was quietly dropped, or a security regression remains unverified (tests passing ≠ security verified)
- Tired and wanting work over
- **ANY wording implying success without having run verification**

## Rationalization Prevention

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Should work now" | RUN the verification |
| "I'm confident" | Confidence ≠ evidence |
| "Just this once" | No exceptions |
| "Linter passed" | Linter ≠ compiler |
| "Agent said success" | Verify independently |
| "I'm tired" | Exhaustion ≠ excuse |
| "Partial check is enough" | Partial proves nothing |
| "It's good enough to ship" | Production system, real users — no shortcut, no dropped requirement, no accepted security regression |
| "Different words so rule doesn't apply" | Spirit over letter |

## Key Patterns

**Tests:**
```
✅ [Run test command] [See: 34/34 pass] "All tests pass"
❌ "Should pass now" / "Looks correct"
```

**Regression tests (TDD Red-Green):**
```
✅ Write → Run (pass) → Revert fix → Run (MUST FAIL) → Restore → Run (pass)
❌ "I've written a regression test" (without red-green verification)
```

**Build:**
```
✅ [Run build] [See: exit 0] "Build passes"
❌ "Linter passed" (linter doesn't check compilation)
```

**Requirements:**
```
✅ Re-read plan → Create checklist → Verify each → Report gaps or completion
❌ "Tests pass, phase complete"
```

**Agent delegation:**
```
✅ Agent reports success → Check VCS diff → Verify changes → Report actual state
❌ Trust agent report
```

## Why This Matters

From 24 failure memories:
- your human partner said "I don't believe you" - trust broken
- Undefined functions shipped - would crash
- Missing requirements shipped - incomplete features
- Time wasted on false completion → redirect → rework
- Violates: "Honesty is a core value. If you lie, you'll be replaced."

## When To Apply

**ALWAYS before:**
- ANY variation of success/completion claims
- ANY expression of satisfaction
- ANY positive statement about work state
- Committing, PR creation, task completion
- Moving to next task
- Delegating to agents

**Rule applies to:**
- Exact phrases
- Paraphrases and synonyms
- Implications of success
- ANY communication suggesting completion/correctness

## Beads Completion

`bd close` without fresh verification evidence is lying. Before closing any bead:
1. Run the verification command that proves the work is done
2. Annotate the bead with evidence: `bd note <id> "test output: 14 passed, 0 failed"`
3. Include the summary in the `--reason` flag
4. Only then execute `bd close`

Use `bd note` to attach detailed evidence (test output, diff stats, verification logs) to the bead before closing. The `--reason` flag is the summary; `bd note` is the full evidence trail.

A bead closed without evidence is worse than a bead left open — it corrupts the ledger.

If you discovered something reusable, capture it before closing:

```bash
# Only if worth preserving for future sessions:
bd remember "lesson: <what was learned during this task>"
```

## The Bottom Line

**No shortcuts for verification.**

Run the command. Read the output. THEN claim the result.

This is non-negotiable.

## Integration

**Invoked by:** Any task claiming completion — mandatory before `bd close`, commits, or PRs.

**Pairs with:**
- **systematic-debugging** — verify the fix worked before claiming success.
- **document-release** — docs audit is part of completion evidence.
- **write-documentation** — prose quality checks are completion evidence.
- **stress-test** — stress-test validates designs; this skill validates implementations.
