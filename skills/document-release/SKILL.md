# Document Release: Post-Ship Documentation Update

> **Source:** Adapted from [garrytan/gstack](https://github.com/garrytan/gstack/tree/main/document-release) (Garry Tan)

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the document-release skill to audit and update project documentation."

Run after code changes are committed but before PR merge. Ensures all project documentation accurately reflects shipped code.

## Beads Integration

```bash
# Create a doc-update bead at start
bd create "Docs: update documentation for <branch>" -t chore

# Close with evidence at completion
bd close <id> --reason "Documentation updated: <summary of changes>"
```

## Key Operating Principles

**Automation with guardrails:** Make obvious factual corrections automatically (path updates, version numbers, table additions) but pause for subjective decisions (narrative changes, security model updates, large rewrites, version bumps).

**Auto-update (apply without asking):**
- Factual corrections derived directly from the diff
- Adding items to existing lists and tables
- Updating file paths, counts, and version numbers
- Fixing stale cross-references between documents
- Minor CHANGELOG wording polish (preserving all content)
- Marking TODOs as complete

**Always ask before:**
- Narrative or philosophy changes
- Removing any section
- Security model rewrites
- Large rewrites (10+ lines in one section)
- VERSION bumps
- New TODO items

## Audit Methodology (9-Step Process)

### Step 0: Platform Detection
Detect git platform (GitHub/GitLab/unknown) and determine the base branch. Use `gh`/`glab` if available, fall back to git-native commands.

### Step 1: Pre-flight and Diff Analysis
1. Verify you are on a feature branch (not base branch)
2. Gather what changed: `git diff <base>..HEAD` and `git log --oneline <base>..HEAD`
3. Discover all `.md` files: `find . -name '*.md' -not -path './.git/*' -not -path './.worktrees/*'`
4. Categorise changes: new features, behaviour changes, removals, infrastructure

### Step 1.5: Coverage Map (Diataxis Blast-Radius Audit)

Catches **missing** docs (shipped public surface that was never documented) — the per-file audit (Step 2) only catches **stale** docs.

1. **Extract new public surface** from `git diff <base>..HEAD`. "Public surface" is whatever the project exposes to users — a general superset, not any one project type:
   - **Apps:** new API endpoints, CLI flags, config keys, env vars.
   - **Libraries:** new exported functions, classes, public types.
   - **Tools / plugins:** new skills, user-facing commands, hooks, manifest fields, install flags.
   - …plus any renamed or removed surface in the above.
2. **Grid each item against the four Diataxis quadrants** (definitions are generic; the doc targets in parentheses are *examples*, never a hardcoded file list):
   - **Reference** — factual descriptions, signatures, option lists (README tables, AGENTS.md lists)
   - **How-to** — task-oriented guidance (README examples, CONTRIBUTING workflows)
   - **Tutorial** — step-by-step learning paths (getting-started guides)
   - **Explanation** — rationale and design reasoning (ARCHITECTURE, design docs, ADRs)

   ```text
   <entity>     reference  how-to  tutorial  explanation
   <entity-1>   yes        no      no        no
   <entity-2>   yes        yes     no        no
   ```
3. **Calibrate gaps (avoid alert-fatigue).** The grid *shows* all four cells, but only **judgment-confirmed gaps** become debt: a new user-facing surface with **zero** coverage anywhere, OR missing the **one quadrant that surface type genuinely needs** (e.g. a new flag with no Reference; a new workflow with no How-to). Tutorial/Explanation are flagged only when the change is significant enough to warrant them. An empty cell the entity genuinely doesn't need is **not** a gap.
4. **Guardrail — informs, never generates.** The coverage map flags gaps for beads + the PR body; it does **not** auto-write doc pages. Point real gaps at the **`write-documentation`** skill as the follow-up.
5. **Diagram-drift sub-check (flag-only).** Scope to **entity-bearing diagrams** — architecture / component / data-flow diagrams whose labels name code entities (e.g. `ARCHITECTURE.md`, or `docs/*.md` Mermaid). Extract entity names, cross-reference the diff, and flag any the diff **renamed or removed**. Prose/workflow flowcharts (e.g. process `dot` graphs) are in scope only when a renamed skill/command/step is itself the label. Never auto-edit a diagram.
6. **Empty-check gate (conservative early exit).** After building the coverage map, if the diff is **unambiguously doc-irrelevant** — both (a) `git diff <base>..HEAD --name-only -- '*.md'` is empty (zero docs changed) **and** (b) the coverage map found **no** new user-facing surface — emit "All documentation is up to date" and exit without an empty commit. **When in doubt, do not exit — run the full audit (Steps 2–9).** A false-skip would ship undocumented surface (the failure this skill exists to prevent), which is strictly worse than a redundant audit.

### Step 2: Per-File Documentation Audit
Read each documentation file and cross-reference against the diff:

| File | What to Check |
|------|--------------|
| **README** | Features, install steps, examples, troubleshooting still valid? |
| **ARCHITECTURE** | Diagrams, component descriptions, design rationale still accurate? |
| **CONTRIBUTING** | Setup instructions work? Test tiers match reality? |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Project structure tree, commands, build/test steps current? |
| **CHANGELOG** | Entries present for all changes? Voice user-forward? |
| **Any other .md** | Purpose clear, contradictions with diff? |

Classify each update as **auto-update** (factual, obvious) or **ask-user** (narrative, ambiguous, risky).

### Step 3: Apply Auto-Updates
Make factual corrections directly. Each edit gets a specific one-line summary — not "updated README" but "README: added /new-skill to skills table, updated count 15 to 16".

### Step 4: Ask About Risky Changes
Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for risky changes. Provide context, recommendation, and options.

### Step 5: CHANGELOG Voice Polish
**Critical rules:**
- Never clobber entries — polish wording only, preserve all content
- Use Edit tool with exact string matches — never use Write to overwrite CHANGELOG.md
- Ensure each bullet leads with what the user can *do*, not implementation details
- Flag commit-message-style entries for rewrite to user-forward language

### Step 6: Cross-Doc Consistency
1. Check README/CLAUDE.md/ARCHITECTURE alignment
2. Ensure every doc file is reachable from one entry point (README or CLAUDE.md)
3. Fix clear factual inconsistencies (e.g., version mismatch between files)

### Step 7: TODOS Cleanup
1. Mark completed items based on the diff
2. Update stale TODO descriptions
3. Ask whether inline code comments (`TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`) represent meaningful deferred work

### Step 8: VERSION Bump Decision
**Critical rule:** Never bump silently — always use `AskUserQuestion`.
- If VERSION was not bumped: ask whether to bump PATCH/MINOR or skip
- If VERSION was already bumped: verify scope coverage; ask if gaps exist
- Use `scripts/bump-version.sh` if available

### Step 9: Commit and Output
1. Stage modified doc files by name (never `git add -A`)
2. Create a single commit: `docs: update project documentation (bd-<id>)`
3. Push to the branch
4. Update the PR body with a `## Documentation` section if PR exists
5. Output a health summary table:

```
| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| README.md | ✅ Updated | Added new skill to table |
| CLAUDE.md | ✅ Current | No changes needed |
| CHANGELOG.md | ✅ Polished | Voice improvements |
```

6. Close the bead: `bd close <id> --reason "Documentation updated: <summary>"`

## Critical Rules

- **Read before editing:** Understand file content before modifying
- **Never clobber CHANGELOG:** Polish wording only. Use Edit with exact matches.
- **Never bump VERSION silently:** Always ask, even if already bumped
- **Be specific about changes:** Every edit gets a one-line summary
- **Discoverability:** Every doc file must be reachable from README or CLAUDE.md

If you discovered something reusable, capture it before closing:

```bash
# Only if worth preserving for future sessions:
bd remember "docs: <documentation pattern or gap found>"
```

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **finishing-a-development-branch** — RECOMMENDED before merge/PR options
- Any workflow where code has shipped and docs need updating

**Pairs with:**
- **verification-before-completion** — docs audit is part of completion verification
- **writing-plans** — plans reference doc locations that this skill validates
- **write-documentation** — complementary; document-release syncs existing docs to shipped code, write-documentation handles writing or rewriting prose
