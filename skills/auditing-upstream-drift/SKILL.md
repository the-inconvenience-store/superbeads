# Auditing Upstream Drift

This is the quality gate for the beads-superpowers plugin. It verifies everything — upstream staleness, test pass rates, documentation accuracy, plugin manifest validity, hook functionality, content integrity, and beads integration completeness.

**Iron Law:** NO PLUGIN RELEASE WITHOUT A FULL AUDIT FIRST. Audit findings with security or material-risk impact are never downgraded to make a release, and phases are never skipped for a date (Production-Grade Doctrine).

## When to Use

- Before any plugin version bump or release
- Monthly (or after upstream releases of superpowers or beads)
- When a user reports a skill behaves differently than expected
- When beads adds new CLI features that skills should leverage
- After any bulk refactoring of skills or tests
- After merging upstream changes

## Upstream Sources

| Source | Repository | Our Baseline | What We Track |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Superpowers** | [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | v6.0.3 | Skills content, new skills, hook structure, plugin manifest |
| **Beads** | [gastownhall/beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) | v1.0.5 | CLI commands, new features, bd prime format, deprecations |

## Known Deliberate Divergences

These shared skills intentionally differ from upstream superpowers. When Phase 5 (Check 5.3) flags them as CHANGED, that is expected — do **not** revert them toward upstream. Adopt only upstream changes that don't reverse these decisions.

| Area / Skill | We do | Upstream does | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **All shared skills** | `bd` task tracking — beads is the ledger | `TodoWrite` / markdown TODOs | The fork's reason for existence: cross-session persistence |
| **using-git-worktrees, finishing-a-development-branch** | `bd worktree` Iron Law; reject native-tool-first selection | native worktree tool first → `.worktrees/` → raw `git worktree` | native-first bypasses beads-DB sharing across worktrees (ADR-0014; audit finding #6) |
| **finishing-a-development-branch** | Land the Plane (`bd close` → `bd dolt push` → `git push`) | no session-close ritual | core to the beads workflow |
| **subagent-driven-development** | beads is the durable ledger; Parallel Batch Mode kept; `bd merge-slot` optional | markdown progress ledger | beads survives compaction; single orchestrator already serializes merges (ADR-0013, ADR-0012) |
| **using-superpowers, writing-skills** | Claude Code tool names + per-CLI `references/` maps | fully vendor-neutral tool vocabulary | we ship multi-CLI adapters, not one neutral vocabulary (ADR-0006) |
| **Beads integration** | CLI-only: call `bd` directly in skills + one SessionStart `bd prime` hook; no beads Claude plugin or beads-mcp server | Claude plugin + MCP server | Lowest overhead; full `bd` command coverage; matches beads' own "CLI + hooks when shell is available" guidance (ADR-0017) |
| **brainstorming, writing-plans** | stress-test (a fork-only skill) is offered at the approval gate via a 3-option "Approved + stress-test" gate folded into the upstream Approved/Needs-changes review gate | 2-option review gate; no stress-test (stress-test does not exist upstream) | stress-test is one of our 7 fork-unique skills; offering it at every spec/plan gate is intended fork behavior (ADR-0020) |
| **using-superpowers** | carries a fork-only `## Production-Grade Doctrine` block (treat every project as production-facing; no shortcuts/descope/material-risk; never a security regression) | no such doctrine (obra/superpowers has none) | intended fork behavior (ADR-0023); a future audit marks it SKIP, not Conflict |
| **All shared skills (namespace)** | cross-skill references use `beads-superpowers:<skill>` | bare `superpowers:<skill>` | upstream's bare namespace points at the upstream plugin; in our fork it must carry our plugin name or it resolves to the wrong plugin (intended; mark SKIP, not Conflict) |

When a CHANGED skill from Phase 5 matches a row here, mark it **SKIP (deliberate divergence)** in the report — not drift.

## The Audit Process

You MUST create an audit bead and complete ALL 7 phases in order:

```bash
bd create "Audit: full plugin health check" -t chore -p 1
bd update <audit-id> --claim
```

---

### Phase 1: Plugin Infrastructure Health

Verify the plugin itself is structurally sound before checking content.

**Check 1.1 — Plugin manifest validation:**
```bash
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json
# MUST show: ✔ Validation passed
```

If validation fails, the plugin CANNOT be installed. Fix before proceeding.

**Check 1.2 — Version consistency across 6 files:**
```bash
grep '"version"' package.json \
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/marketplace.json \
  .codex-plugin/plugin.json .codex-plugin/marketplace.json \
  opencode/package.json
# ALL SIX must show the same version string (Claude Code + Codex + OpenCode manifests).
# Or use the source of truth: ./scripts/bump-version.sh --check
```

If versions drift, run: `./scripts/bump-version.sh <version>`

**Check 1.3 — Hook is executable and produces valid JSON:**
```bash
# Executable?
test -x hooks/session-start && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: chmod +x hooks/session-start"

# Valid JSON output?
bash hooks/session-start 2>&1 | python3 -m json.tool > /dev/null && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: hook output is not valid JSON"
```

**Check 1.4 — Hook injects both skills AND bd prime:**
```bash
output=$(bash hooks/session-start 2>&1)
echo "$output" | grep -q "using-superpowers" && echo "PASS: skills injected" || echo "FAIL: skills not injected"
echo "$output" | grep -q "beads-context\|bd prime\|Beads Workflow" && echo "PASS: bd prime injected" || echo "FAIL: bd prime not injected"
```

**Check 1.5 — .claude/settings.json points to plugin hook (not bare bd prime):**
```bash
cat .claude/settings.json | grep -q "hooks/session-start" && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: settings.json still uses bare bd prime, not plugin hook"
```

**Check 1.6 — Duplicate hook detection:**
```bash
cat .claude/settings.json | grep -q '"bd prime"' && echo "WARNING: bd setup claude hooks still installed — run bd setup claude --remove" || echo "PASS: no duplicate hooks"
```

**Check 1.7 — Skills count:**
```bash
dirs=$(ls -d skills/*/ | wc -l)
md=$(find skills -maxdepth 2 -name SKILL.md | wc -l)
echo "Skills: $dirs dirs, $md SKILL.md"
[ "$dirs" = "$md" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: $dirs skill dirs but $md SKILL.md files"
# Source of truth (guard): ./scripts/check-skill-count.sh
```

**Check 1.8 — LICENSE attribution:**
```bash
grep -q "Dillon Frawley" LICENSE && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: LICENSE does not have correct attribution"
grep -q "Jesse Vincent" LICENSE && echo "FAIL: LICENSE still has upstream author" || echo "PASS"
```

---

### Phase 2: Test Execution

Run ALL runnable tests. Tests are the ground truth — if they fail, nothing else matters.

**Check 2.1 — Brainstorm server tests (32 tests):**
```bash
cd tests/brainstorm-server
npm install --silent 2>/dev/null
node server.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1
# MUST show: --- Results: 32 passed, 0 failed ---
```

**Check 2.2 — WebSocket protocol tests (31 tests):**
```bash
cd tests/brainstorm-server
node ws-protocol.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1
# MUST show: --- Results: 31 passed, 0 failed ---
```

**Check 2.3 — Auth/security tests (20 tests):**
```bash
cd tests/brainstorm-server
node auth.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1
# MUST show: --- Results: 20 passed, 0 failed ---
```

**Check 2.4 — Claude Code fast skill tests (9 subtests):**
```bash
cd <repo-root>
bash tests/claude-code/run-skill-tests.sh --timeout 600 2>&1 | tail -5
# MUST show: STATUS: PASSED
```

This runs real Claude API calls (~$0.10, ~165s). Tests verify:
- Skill is recognised and loaded
- Workflow ordering (spec compliance before code quality)
- Self-review requirement documented
- Plan reading efficiency documented
- Spec reviewer scepticism documented
- Review loops documented
- Full task text provided directly (not file reference)
- Worktree requirement mentioned
- Main branch warning present

**Check 2.5 — Integration test (OPTIONAL, ~$4-5, 10-30 min):**
```bash
bash tests/claude-code/run-skill-tests.sh --integration --timeout 2400 2>&1
# Full end-to-end: creates project, executes plan via subagents, verifies output
```

Only run this before a release or after major workflow changes. It validates:
- Real subagent dispatching
- Beads (bd create/close) used for task tracking
- Implementation files created and tests pass
- Git commits made
- Correct skill namespace (`beads-superpowers:subagent-driven-development`)

**If any test fails: STOP. Fix the test failure before proceeding with the audit.**

---

### Phase 3: Content Integrity

Verify the beads integration is complete and no stale references remain.

**Check 3.1 — Zero active TodoWrite references:**
```bash
bash scripts/check-todowrite.sh && echo "PASS: zero active TodoWrite" || echo "FAIL: see output above"
```

The only allowed TodoWrite references are prohibitions ("Do NOT use TodoWrite", "TodoWrite is forbidden") and this audit skill's own grep patterns.

**Check 3.2 — Zero stale docs/superpowers/ paths:**
```bash
results=$(grep -rn "docs/superpowers" skills/ tests/ | grep -v "auditing-upstream-drift")
[ -z "$results" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: stale paths found: $results"
```

All paths should use `.internal/`.

**Check 3.3 — Zero stale skill namespace references:**
```bash
results=$(grep -rn '"superpowers:' skills/ tests/ | grep -v "beads-superpowers:")
[ -z "$results" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: stale namespaces: $results"
```

**Check 3.4 — Zero stale plugin-dir paths:**
```bash
results=$(grep -rn "/path/to/superpowers" tests/)
[ -z "$results" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: stale plugin paths: $results"
```

**Check 3.5 — Zero TodoWrite in tests:**
```bash
results=$(grep -rn "TodoWrite" tests/ | grep -v "tests/skills/test-todowrite-gate.sh")
[ -z "$results" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: TodoWrite in tests: $results"
```

**Check 3.6 — Beads command density (must be 30+):**
```bash
count=$(grep -rn "bd create\|bd close\|bd ready\|bd update\|bd dep\|bd dolt" skills/ | wc -l)
echo "Beads command references in skills: $count (minimum: 30)"
[ "$count" -ge 30 ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: insufficient beads integration"
```

**Check 3.7 — Reviewer prompt must NOT reference beads:**
```bash
# Orchestrator-only design: the reviewer subagent does not touch beads.
# (implementer-prompt.md is the documented EXCEPTION — it IS beads-aware by
#  design: it claims and closes its own task bead. Do not add it here.)
for f in skills/subagent-driven-development/task-reviewer-prompt.md; do
    count=$(grep -cE "bd create|bd close|bd update|bd ready" "$f" 2>/dev/null) || count=0
    [ "$count" -eq 0 ] && echo "PASS: $(basename $f) clean" || echo "FAIL: $(basename $f) has $count bd references"
done
```

**Check 3.8 — Convention-block sync (verbatim canonical blocks):**
```bash
bash scripts/check-convention-sync.sh
```

The cross-cutting convention blocks (doctrine floor, Capture gate, memory convention) are duplicated across skills by design and MUST be byte-identical at every site. Any divergent or missing copy fails this check.

---

### Phase 4: Progressive Skill Chain Integrity

The skills form a pipeline. Every link must be intact.

```bash
echo "=== Progressive Skill Chain ==="

# brainstorming → writing-plans (terminal state)
grep -q "writing-plans" skills/brainstorming/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: brainstorming → writing-plans" || echo "FAIL"

# writing-plans → subagent-driven-development OR executing-plans
grep -q "subagent-driven-development" skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: writing-plans → subagent-driven-dev" || echo "FAIL"
grep -q "executing-plans" skills/writing-plans/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: writing-plans → executing-plans" || echo "FAIL"

# subagent-driven-development → finishing-a-development-branch
grep -q "finishing-a-development-branch" skills/subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: subagent-driven-dev → finishing" || echo "FAIL"

# executing-plans → finishing-a-development-branch
grep -q "finishing-a-development-branch" skills/executing-plans/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: executing-plans → finishing" || echo "FAIL"

# finishing-a-development-branch has Land the Plane
grep -q "Land the Plane" skills/finishing-a-development-branch/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: finishing has Land the Plane" || echo "FAIL"

# using-superpowers has Beads Issue Tracking section
grep -q "Beads Issue Tracking" skills/using-superpowers/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: bootstrap has beads awareness" || echo "FAIL"

# verification-before-completion has Beads Completion section
grep -q "Beads Completion" skills/verification-before-completion/SKILL.md && echo "PASS: verification has beads completion" || echo "FAIL"
```

---

### Phase 5: Upstream Superpowers Drift

Clone upstream and compare.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/obra/superpowers.git /tmp/superpowers-upstream
```

**Check 5.1 — Version gap:**
```bash
upstream_ver=$(grep '"version"' /tmp/superpowers-upstream/package.json | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
echo "Upstream: v$upstream_ver | Our baseline: v6.0.3"
```

**Check 5.2 — New skills in upstream:**
```bash
diff <(ls /tmp/superpowers-upstream/skills/) <(ls skills/) | grep "^<"
# Lines starting with < are skills upstream has that we don't
```

For each new skill: assess if relevant (skip platform-specific ones).

**Check 5.3 — Content changes in shared skills:**
```bash
for skill in /tmp/superpowers-upstream/skills/*/SKILL.md; do
    name=$(basename $(dirname "$skill"))
    if [ -f "skills/$name/SKILL.md" ]; then
        changes=$(diff "$skill" "skills/$name/SKILL.md" | wc -l)
        [ "$changes" -gt 0 ] && echo "CHANGED: $name ($changes diff lines)"
    fi
done
```

For changed skills, categorise each:
- **Safe merge**: Change doesn't touch our beads-integrated sections
- **Conflict**: Change touches our modified sections → manual review
- **New content**: New sections added → assess and add with beads awareness

**Before categorising, check [Known Deliberate Divergences](#known-deliberate-divergences)** — skills listed there are *expected* to be CHANGED; mark them SKIP (deliberate divergence), not Conflict.

**Check 5.4 — New companion files:**
```bash
for dir in /tmp/superpowers-upstream/skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$dir")
    if [ -d "skills/$name" ]; then
        new_files=$(diff <(ls "$dir" 2>/dev/null | sort) <(ls "skills/$name" 2>/dev/null | sort) | grep "^<" | sed 's/^< //')
        [ -n "$new_files" ] && echo "NEW FILES in $name: $new_files"
    fi
done
```

**Check 5.5 — Hook and manifest changes:**
```bash
diff /tmp/superpowers-upstream/hooks/hooks.json hooks/hooks.json | head -20
diff /tmp/superpowers-upstream/.claude-plugin/plugin.json .claude-plugin/plugin.json | head -20
```

Our hook is intentionally different (adds bd prime). Check for structural changes, new hook types, or new manifest fields.

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/superpowers-upstream
```

---

### Phase 6: Upstream Beads Drift

Check if beads has new capabilities our skills should use.

**Check 6.1 — Beads version:**
```bash
bd version
# Compare against our baseline (v1.0.5)
```

**Check 6.2 — New or changed bd commands:**
```bash
bd --help 2>&1 | head -60
# Look for new commands not in our skills' Quick Reference tables
```

**Check 6.3 — bd prime format:**
```bash
bd prime 2>&1 | head -20
# Compare structure against what hooks/session-start expects
```

**Check 6.4 — New beads features to watch:**
- New dependency types → update `bd dep add` references
- New issue types → update `bd create -t` references
- New status codes → update lifecycle references
- New CLI flags → update quick reference tables
- Changes to gate/molecule/formula system → assess skill impact

---

### Phase 7: Documentation Accuracy

Verify all documentation reflects the current state.

**Check 7.1 — README skills count matches actual:**
```bash
actual=$(ls -d skills/*/ | wc -l)
readme_count=$(grep -o "[0-9]* skills" README.md | head -1 | grep -o "[0-9]*")
echo "Actual: $actual | README: $readme_count"
[ "$actual" = "$readme_count" ] && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL: README skills count is stale"
```

**Check 7.2 — README skills table has all skills:**
```bash
for dir in skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$dir")
    grep -q "$name" README.md && echo "PASS: $name in README" || echo "FAIL: $name missing from README"
done
```

**Check 7.3 — CHANGELOG has current version:**
```bash
version=$(grep '"version"' package.json | grep -o '[0-9.]*')
grep -q "\[$version\]" CHANGELOG.md && echo "PASS: v$version in CHANGELOG" || echo "FAIL: v$version missing from CHANGELOG"
```

**Check 7.4 — CLAUDE.md skills table matches actual:**
```bash
for dir in skills/*/; do
    name=$(basename "$dir")
    grep -q "$name" CLAUDE.md && echo "PASS: $name in CLAUDE.md" || echo "FAIL: $name missing from CLAUDE.md"
done
```

**Check 7.5 — SETUP-GUIDE install commands use correct names:**
```bash
grep -q "DollarDill/beads-superpowers" .internal/SETUP-GUIDE.md && echo "PASS: correct marketplace repo" || echo "FAIL"
grep -q "beads-superpowers@beads-superpowers-marketplace" .internal/SETUP-GUIDE.md && echo "PASS: correct install command" || echo "FAIL"
```

**Check 7.6 — Copied upstream docs don't have stale references:**
```bash
# These docs were adapted from superpowers — verify no stale refs
for f in .internal/testing.md .internal/windows/polyglot-hooks.md tests/claude-code/README.md; do
    stale=$(grep -c "superpowers" "$f" | head -1)
    allowed=$(grep -c "beads-superpowers\|obra/superpowers\|upstream" "$f" | head -1)
    raw=$((stale - allowed))
    [ "$raw" -le 0 ] && echo "PASS: $f clean" || echo "WARNING: $f may have $raw stale superpowers refs"
done
```

---

### Phase 8: Generate Audit Report

Create beads for each finding and write the report.

```bash
# Create child beads for each finding
bd create "Drift: [description]" -t chore -p 3 --parent <audit-id>
bd create "CRITICAL: [description]" -t bug -p 0 --parent <audit-id>
```

Write the report to `.internal/audits/YYYY-MM-DD-upstream-drift.md`:

```markdown
# Plugin Audit — YYYY-MM-DD

## Infrastructure
- Plugin manifest: PASS/FAIL
- Version consistency: PASS/FAIL (version)
- Hook functional: PASS/FAIL
- Settings.json: PASS/FAIL
- Skills count: N
- LICENSE: PASS/FAIL

## Tests
- Brainstorm server: N/32 passed

## Actions Required
- [List with bead IDs]
```

Close the audit bead:
```bash
bd close <audit-id> --reason "Audit complete: N findings (C critical, I important, M minor)"
```

---

## Quick Audit (Phases 1-4 Only)

For fast checks without upstream comparison:

```bash
# Run this single block for a quick health check
echo "=== Quick Audit ===" && \
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>&1 | tail -1 && \
test -x hooks/session-start && echo "Hook: executable" && \
bash hooks/session-start 2>&1 | python3 -m json.tool > /dev/null && echo "Hook: valid JSON" && \
echo "Skills: $(ls -d skills/*/ | wc -l)" && \
echo "TodoWrite residue: $(grep -rn 'TodoWrite' skills/ | grep -v 'Do NOT use' | grep -v 'replaces' | grep -v 'auditing-upstream-drift' | wc -l)" && \
echo "Stale paths: $(grep -rn 'docs/superpowers' skills/ tests/ | grep -v 'auditing-upstream-drift' | wc -l)" && \
echo "Stale namespace: $(grep -rn '"superpowers:' skills/ tests/ | grep -v 'beads-superpowers:' | wc -l)" && \
echo "Beads density: $(grep -rn 'bd create\|bd close\|bd ready\|bd update\|bd dep\|bd dolt' skills/ | wc -l)" && \
echo "Version: $(grep '"version"' package.json | grep -o '[0-9.]*')" && \
cd tests/brainstorm-server && node server.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1 && node ws-protocol.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1 && node auth.test.js 2>&1 | tail -1 && cd ../.. && \
echo "=== Quick Audit Complete ==="
```

## Audit Frequency

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Before any plugin release | Full audit (all 8 phases) — MANDATORY |
| Monthly | Phases 1-4 (infrastructure + tests + content + chain) |
| After upstream superpowers release | Add Phase 5 |
| After upstream beads release | Add Phase 6 |
| After bulk skill edits | Phases 2-4 (tests + content + chain) |
| After test refactoring | Phase 2 only (run all tests) |
| User reports mismatch | Phase 3 check 3.x for the specific issue + Phase 5 check 5.3 for the skill |
| Quick sanity check | Quick Audit block above |

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf /tmp/superpowers-upstream
```

**Capture what you learned.** At close, record every durable, evidence-backed insight from this work — anything still true next month, tied to a file, test, or command. Don't skip because it feels minor: if it would save a future session time or stop a repeated mistake, record it. Never record guesses, one-offs, or secrets (tokens, keys, PII — every memory is injected into all future sessions). Update an existing memory in place (`bd remember --key <key>`) rather than adding a near-duplicate.

```bash
bd remember "<kind>: <durable, evidence-backed insight>"   # kind: lesson / pattern / design / root-cause / research
```

## Integration

**Invoked by:** No other skill invokes this directly. Standalone audit skill — run before releases or on-demand.

**Invokes:** None. References other skills as audit targets but does not invoke them.
