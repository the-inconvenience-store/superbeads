"""MkDocs build hooks for beads-superpowers.

Currently carries one compatibility shim:

mkdocs-static-i18n compatibility for mkdocs-panzoom-plugin
---------------------------------------------------------
mkdocs-static-i18n runs a separate build pass per locale (see its
``on_post_build`` → ``build()``), which re-invokes every plugin's
``on_config``. mkdocs-panzoom-plugin 0.5.2 (the latest release) does
``self.config.pop("mermaid")`` (and four sibling keys) with no default in
``on_config``. Because the panzoom plugin instance — and thus ``self.config``
— persists across passes, the second (zh) pass finds those keys already gone
and raises ``KeyError: 'mermaid'``, aborting the build.

We cannot fix this by monkeypatching ``PanZoomPlugin.on_config``: mkdocs
captures each plugin's bound event method when the plugin is registered, which
happens *before* hook modules are imported — so a late class patch is never
dispatched. Instead we register our own high-priority ``on_config`` handler
that runs *before* panzoom's on every pass: it snapshots the popped option
values on the first pass and restores them on later passes, so panzoom's pops
always succeed with the real values.

Remove this shim once panzoom guards its pops upstream (e.g. ``pop(key, None)``).
Tracked in the zh-docs epic bead + an upstream issue.
