# beads-superpowers — Claude Code Plugin

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, plus project-specific instructions.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Overview

A plugin for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode (verified) plus 7 best-effort harnesses — Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, Antigravity, Factory Droid, and Pi — that merges [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills (v6.0.3) with [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) issue tracking (v1.0.5). It gives AI coding agents 23 composable process-discipline skills (TDD, brainstorming, systematic debugging, code review, verification) plus persistent task memory via a Dolt-backed database.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/DollarDill/beads-superpowers>
**Version:** 0.8.1
**License:** MIT (fork of obra/superpowers, also MIT)

## Architecture

- `.claude-plugin/` — Claude Code plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace config (`marketplace.json`). Auto-discovered by Claude Code.
- `.codex-plugin/` — Codex CLI plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace config (`marketplace.json`). Mirrors `.claude-plugin/` for Codex compatibility.
- `skills/` — 23 skills, each in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Some include prompt templates (`implementer-prompt.md`, `researcher-prompt.md`) or helper scripts. Auto-discovered by Claude Code — do NOT declare in `plugin.json`.
- `agents/` — Removed in v0.6.0. Code-reviewer is now dispatched via `skills/requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md` prompt template. Subagents (implementer, researcher) use prompt templates inside their skills, not standalone agent files.
- `hooks/` — `session-start` (injects `using-superpowers` + `bd prime`) and `superpowers-reminder.sh` (UserPromptSubmit skill trigger reminders). Multi-format output supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and generic CLIs. Registered in `hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code) and `hooks/codex-hooks.json` (Codex). Auto-discovered.
- `opencode/` — Native OpenCode TypeScript plugin (`beads-superpowers-plugin.ts`). In-process hooks for session start, prompt reminders, and compaction resilience. Distributed via `install.sh`.
- `example-workflow/` — Ready-to-use project template: `CLAUDE.md` (Karpathy behavioral principles + beads integration) and `agents/yegge.md` (lean router — triages requests and routes to skills). `install.sh` copies `yegge.md` globally.
- `docs/` — MkDocs Material source pages (6 EN + 6 ZH pages + assets). Template variables (`{{ skill_count }}`) computed at build time via `main.py` macros plugin. Contains ONLY website content.
- `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Local working docs (gitignored).
- `.internal/` — Working docs (gitignored): specs from brainstorming, plans from writing-plans, research output, audits, reference docs.
- `tests/` — 6 test suites: brainstorm-server (Node.js), claude-code skill tests, explicit-skill-requests, installer (Docker E2E), skill-triggering, subagent-driven-dev.
- `scripts/` — `bump-version.sh` (sync version across 9 files), `sync-skill-count.sh` (sync skill counts across all files), `build-docs.sh`, `check-agent-bead-stamp.sh`, `check-zh-docs.sh`, `check-convention-sync.sh` (verify shared convention blocks are byte-identical across skills).
- `install.sh` — curl installer with 3-tier fallback chain (plugin system → npx → tarball/git clone). SHA-256 checksum validation, atomic rollback via staging directory, lazy prerequisites. Auto-detects Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and 7 more CLIs (Cursor, Gemini, Copilot, Droid, Antigravity, Kimi, Pi).
- `mkdocs.yml` + `main.py` + `mkdocs_hooks.py` — MkDocs Material site config, macros plugin, and i18n language-switcher hook.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Skills are pure Markdown** — No executable code in skills. Claude Code auto-discovers `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Platform-agnostic by design. (See: upstream superpowers architecture)
- **Prompt templates over standalone agent files** — Subagent prompts (`implementer-prompt.md`, `researcher-prompt.md`) live inside their skills. Only the orchestrator (`yegge.md`) is a standalone agent file. Prevents drift between skill and dispatch instructions. (See: ADR-0003)
- **`bd` replaces TodoWrite everywhere** — Every `TodoWrite` reference in upstream superpowers replaced with `bd` commands. Beads provides persistent cross-session memory that TodoWrite lacks.
- **Three-layer architecture for example workflow** — `CLAUDE.md` (behavioral principles + project context) + `agents/yegge.md` (orchestration — triage + skill routing) + prompt templates (subagent dispatch). Each layer has a distinct responsibility. (See: ADR-0003, ADR-0032)
- **MkDocs Material for docs site** — HashiCorp/Terraform-style sidebar, dark theme, Mermaid diagrams. Template variables via macros plugin avoid hardcoded counts. (See: ADR-0001)
- **Per-task worktree isolation for parallel SDD** — Independent plan tasks execute in parallel (max 5), each in its own `bd worktree`. Prevents merge conflicts between concurrent subagents. (See: ADR-0002)

## Common Gotchas

- **Embedded Dolt mode** — `.beads/metadata.json` `dolt_mode: embedded` runs the Dolt engine **in-process** (no separate sql-server). This does NOT disable sync: `bd dolt status/show/push/pull` all work and a remote is configured (`origin`, git+ssh). (Verified 2026-06-28: `bd dolt push` → "Push complete".) Genuine push failures are setup-specific (diverged history, GitHub push-protection if a token is in Dolt history) — see the `project-init` skill, not a blanket "embedded fails".
- **`export.git-add` pollutes branches (v1.0.2 and earlier)** — In beads v1.0.2 and earlier, `export.git-add` defaulted to `true`, auto-staging `issues.jsonl` on every commit. Workaround: `bd config set export.git-add false` before branch work. In **v1.0.4+**, auto-export is opt-in by default — no workaround needed. Check with `bd config show`.
- **DCI only works in SKILL.md** — The `!` backtick syntax (Dynamic Context Injection) only works in `SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/*.md`. NOT in agent `.md` files, `CLAUDE.md`, or rules files.
- **Never run `npx skills add` from inside this repo** — It replaces real skill files in `skills/` with symlinks to `.agents/skills/`, destroying the source. Use `-g` flag from `/tmp` or another directory.
- **Never chain `open` after `bd` commands** — `open <file>` hangs when chained in the same Bash invocation with `bd` commands. Always run `open` as a standalone call.
- **Worktree path default** — `bd worktree create <name>` creates at `./<name>` (sibling to repo files), NOT `.worktrees/<name>`. Pass the full path: `bd worktree create .worktrees/<name>`.
- **Worktree detection** — Use `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, NOT `[ -d .git ]`. In a worktree, `.git` is a file, not a directory.
- **Plugin cache goes stale** — After modifying skills, the installed plugin cache is outdated. Symlink the cache to this repo (see "Syncing Source" section below). `claude plugin update` has a [cache bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061).
- **Skill `description` field trap** — Putting workflow descriptions in skill `description` frontmatter causes Claude to follow the description instead of reading the full skill body (SDO problem). Descriptions should state trigger conditions only.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging:

```bash
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

```

**Important:** Claude Code auto-discovers `skills/`, `agents/`, and `hooks/` directories by convention. Do NOT declare these paths in `plugin.json` — it causes validation failures.

## Beads Integration

This plugin uses `bd` (beads) for ALL task tracking.

### Commands Used in Skills

| Action | Command |
|--------|---------|
| Create epic | `bd create "Epic: name" -t epic -p 2` |
| Create task | `bd create "Task: title" -t task --parent <epic-id>` |
| Quick capture | `bd q "title"` |
| Claim work | `bd update <id> --claim` |
| Complete work | `bd close <id> --reason "description"` |
| Check remaining | `bd ready --parent <epic-id>` |
| Explain ready/blocked | `bd ready --explain` |
| Show blocked | `bd blocked` |
| Compound query (replaces list+jq) | `bd query "status=open AND priority<=1"` |
| Count, grouped | `bd count --by-status` (or `--by-priority`/`--by-type`) |
| Epic status | `bd epic status <id>` |
| Add dependency | `bd dep add <child> <depends-on>` |
| Store learning | `bd remember "insight"` |
| Remove stale memory | `bd forget <id>` |
| Search memories | `bd memories <keyword>` |
| Append note to bead | `bd note <id> "context"` |
| Find duplicate beads | `bd find-duplicates` |
| Lint issue sections | `bd lint [id...]` |
| Defer work | `bd defer <id> --until="<date>"` |
| Flag for human decision | `bd human <id>` |
| Validate parallel readiness | `bd swarm validate <epic-id>` |
| Atomic batch operations | `bd batch` (stdin or `-f file`) |
| Run in another directory | `bd -C <path> <command>` |
| Sync beads | `bd dolt push` |
| Sync to GitHub Issues | `bd github push` |

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — never TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODOs
- Only the orchestrating agent manages beads — subagents do NOT touch beads
- Include bead IDs in commit messages: `git commit -m "Add feature (bd-a1b2)"`
- Every session ends with Land the Plane: `bd close` → `bd dolt push` → `git push`
- At session-close, if several new memories were captured, offer a `memory-curator` pass (consolidate/dedup/structure; confirm-never-auto) before the push. On-demand sweep via `Skill(memory-curator)`.

### GitHub Issue Sync

This project syncs beads to GitHub Issues. Issues appear at <https://github.com/DollarDill/beads-superpowers/issues>.

```bash
bd github push              # Push beads to GitHub Issues
bd github pull              # Pull GitHub Issues into beads
bd github status            # Check sync configuration
```

GitHub sync is configured via:

- `bd config set github.token <token>` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN` env var)
- `bd config set github.repository DollarDill/beads-superpowers`

### Duplicate Hook Detection

If `bd setup claude` hooks are installed in any settings file (project or global), the plugin's session-start hook detects them and automatically skips its own `bd prime` call to avoid duplicate context injection. No manual intervention needed.

## Skills (23 Total)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| using-superpowers | Bootstrap — loaded at session start, routes to other skills |
| setup | Post-npx hook installation — configures SessionStart hook |
| brainstorming | Socratic design before code — creates session beads |
| stress-test | Adversarial design interrogation with recommended answers |
| writing-plans | Bite-sized task plans — each task becomes a bead |
| subagent-driven-development | Fresh agent per task + single task review (spec + quality verdicts); parallel batch mode for independent tasks |
| executing-plans | Batch execution in single session |
| test-driven-development | RED-GREEN-REFACTOR — Iron Law: no code without failing test |
| systematic-debugging | 4-phase root cause analysis before proposing fixes |
| verification-before-completion | Evidence before claims — bd close requires evidence |
| requesting-code-review | Dispatches code reviewer subagent |
| receiving-code-review | Anti-sycophancy review reception |
| using-git-worktrees | Isolated development branches |
| finishing-a-development-branch | Merge/PR + Land the Plane (Step 6) |
| document-release | Post-ship documentation audit and sync |
| project-init | Beads/Dolt DB setup, bootstrap, and recovery |
| dispatching-parallel-agents | 2+ independent tasks without shared state |
| writing-skills | Meta-skill for creating/modifying skills |
| auditing-upstream-drift | Detect staleness vs upstream superpowers/beads |
| getting-up-to-speed | Session orientation — bd context + adaptive codebase deep-dive + structured current-state summary |
| research-driven-development | Parallel research agents → synthesized knowledge base document. Triggers on "research this", "what is X", "how does Y work" |
| write-documentation | Human-quality prose for all human-facing text — 14-rule writing system with context-first drafting and required checks |
| memory-curator | Session-close/on-demand memory consolidation — quality-gated extract, dedup, consolidate, prune (evidence-led) |

## Modifying Skills

### Adding a New Skill

1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name
   description: When to use this skill (trigger condition, not workflow summary)
   ---
   ```

2. Make it beads-aware: use `bd create`/`bd close`/`bd ready` for task tracking
3. If it has a checklist, create beads per checklist item
4. Update CLAUDE.md skills table (count and row) and CHANGELOG.md

### Modifying an Existing Skill

1. **Do NOT remove** anti-rationalization tables, Iron Laws, or Red Flags sections
2. **Do NOT add** TodoWrite references — use `bd` commands
3. **Do NOT modify** the task review prompt (`task-reviewer-prompt.md`) with beads commands — orchestrator only. Exception: `implementer-prompt.md` IS beads-aware by design (includes skill invocations, bead lifecycle, LSP instructions).
4. Verify after changes: run `bash scripts/check-todowrite.sh` — must report "No active TodoWrite references"

### Key Anti-Patterns

- Putting workflow descriptions in skill `description` fields (causes Claude to follow description instead of reading full skill — see SDO in docs/methodology.md)
- Softening bright-line rules ("consider" instead of "MUST")
- Adding platform-specific code to skills (skills are pure Markdown)

## Build & Test

Skills are plain Markdown. The docs site uses MkDocs Material.

### Validation

```bash
# Validate plugin manifests
claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/plugin.json

# Sync skill counts across all files (idempotent)
./scripts/sync-skill-count.sh

# Verify skill counts are consistent
./scripts/sync-skill-count.sh --check

# Verify zero active TodoWrite references (canonical gate)
bash scripts/check-todowrite.sh

# Verify agent-filed bead discipline convention present at all required sites
bash scripts/check-agent-bead-stamp.sh

# Verify zh docs structure/term parity
bash scripts/check-zh-docs.sh

# Verify shared convention blocks are byte-identical across skills
bash scripts/check-convention-sync.sh

# Verify beads integration (should be 30+)
grep -r "bd create\|bd close\|bd ready" skills/ | wc -l

# Test hook output
bash hooks/session-start 2>&1 | python3 -m json.tool

# Build docs site locally
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-macros-plugin mkdocs-static-i18n  # one-time
mkdocs build --strict                              # build
mkdocs serve                                       # preview at http://localhost:8000
```

### Running Skill Tests

```bash
# Fast tests (skill content verification, ~2 min)
cd tests/claude-code && ./run-skill-tests.sh

# Integration tests (full workflow execution, 10-30 min)
cd tests/claude-code && ./run-skill-tests.sh --integration
```

### Running Installer E2E Test

```bash
# Requires Docker. Tests install/re-install/uninstall + checksum validation,
# fallback chain, atomic rollback, and bd integration in a clean container.
./tests/installer/run-tests.sh

# Quick local test (no Docker required) — install/verify/uninstall in /tmp
bash install.sh --test
```

## Version Management

Version is declared in 9 files that must stay in sync:

- `package.json`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `opencode/package.json`
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `gemini-extension.json`
- `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json`

Use `scripts/bump-version.sh` to update all at once:

```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.5.3        # Bump to new version
./scripts/bump-version.sh --check      # Detect version drift
```

## Installation (for users, not contributors)

Native per-CLI plugin install is the recommended path (see README for the full tiered matrix: Verified = Claude Code/Codex/OpenCode; Best-effort = Cursor/Gemini/Copilot). `curl | bash` remains a fully-functional scoped fallback. Install `bd` first (`brew install beads`), then the plugin, then `bd init`.

```bash
# Option A (recommended): Claude Code Marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add DollarDill/beads-superpowers
claude plugin install beads-superpowers@beads-superpowers-marketplace

# Option B: Codex CLI Marketplace
codex plugin marketplace add DollarDill/beads-superpowers
codex plugin install beads-superpowers@beads-superpowers-marketplace
# Then enable hooks: add [features] codex_hooks = true to ~/.codex/config.toml

# Option C: scripted install (scoped fallback — beads/Dolt bootstrap, npx/scripted hook
# registration, optional yegge.md agent, version pinning via --version, CI)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DollarDill/beads-superpowers/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Example Workflow

The `example-workflow/` directory provides a ready-to-use development workflow:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Karpathy's 4 behavioral principles + beads integration (generic template for any project) |
| `agents/yegge.md` | Orchestrator agent — lean router: triage table, full-flow routing, always-true rules, session protocol. Named after Steve Yegge (beads creator). Installed globally by `install.sh`. |

Subagents (researcher, implementer, code-reviewer) are dispatched via **prompt templates** within their skills — no standalone agent files. The `researcher-prompt.md` is named after Jesse Vincent (superpowers creator).

## Syncing Source to Installed Plugin

After modifying skills, the installed plugin cache at `~/.claude/plugins/cache/beads-superpowers-marketplace/beads-superpowers/0.8.1/` goes stale.

**Recommended:** Symlink the cache to this repo (one-time, survives edits):

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/cache/beads-superpowers-marketplace/beads-superpowers/0.8.1
ln -s ~/workplace/beads-superpowers \
  ~/.claude/plugins/cache/beads-superpowers-marketplace/beads-superpowers/0.8.1
```

**Quick check for drift:** `diff -rq skills/ ~/.claude/plugins/cache/beads-superpowers-marketplace/beads-superpowers/0.8.1/skills/`

**Note:** `claude plugin update` has a [cache bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061) — use symlink instead.

## Upstream Sources

| Source | Version | What We Track |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | v6.0.3 (baseline) | Skill content, new skills, hook changes |
| [gastownhall/beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) | v1.0.5 (baseline) | CLI commands, new features, bd prime format |

Use the `auditing-upstream-drift` skill to check for staleness.
