# beads-superpowers — Claude Code Plugin

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, plus project-specific instructions.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

```text
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project Overview

A plugin for Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode (verified) plus 6 best-effort harnesses — Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, Antigravity, Factory Droid, and Pi — that merges [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) skills (v6.0.3) with [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) issue tracking (v1.0.5). It gives AI coding agents composable process-discipline skills (TDD, brainstorming, systematic debugging, code review, verification) plus persistent task memory via a Dolt-backed database.

**Repository:** <https://github.com/DollarDill/beads-superpowers>
**Version:** 0.9.0
**License:** MIT (fork of obra/superpowers, also MIT)

## Architecture

- `.claude-plugin/` — Claude Code plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace config (`marketplace.json`). Auto-discovered by Claude Code.
- `.codex-plugin/` — Codex CLI plugin manifest (`plugin.json`) and marketplace config (`marketplace.json`). Mirrors `.claude-plugin/` for Codex compatibility.
- `skills/` — one skill per `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` directory. Some include prompt templates (`implementer-prompt.md`, `researcher-prompt.md`) or helper scripts. Auto-discovered by Claude Code — do NOT declare in `plugin.json`.
- `agents/` — Removed in v0.6.0. Code-reviewer is now dispatched via `skills/requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md` prompt template. Subagents (implementer, researcher) use prompt templates inside their skills, not standalone agent files.
- `hooks/` — `session-start` (SessionStart: injects `using-superpowers` + `bd prime`), the single recurring hook. Multi-format output supports Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and generic CLIs. Registered in `hooks/hooks.json` (Claude Code) and `hooks/codex-hooks.json` (Codex). Auto-discovered.
- `opencode/` — Native OpenCode TypeScript plugin (`beads-superpowers-plugin.ts`). Two in-process hooks: a once-per-session bootstrap and a compaction re-injection. Distributed via `install.sh`.
- `example-workflow/` — Ready-to-use project template: `CLAUDE.md` (Karpathy behavioral principles + beads integration) and `agents/yegge.md` (lean router — triages requests and routes to skills). `install.sh` copies `yegge.md` globally.
- `docs/` — MkDocs Material source pages (6 EN + 6 ZH pages + assets). Template variables (`{{ skill_count }}`) computed at build time via `main.py` macros plugin. Contains ONLY website content.
- `decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records (ADRs). Local working docs (gitignored).
- `.internal/` — Working docs (gitignored): specs from brainstorming, plans from writing-plans, research output, audits, reference docs, `.internal/sdd/` (SDD scratch), and `.internal/brainstorm/` (brainstorm server sessions).
- `tests/` — deterministic suites (hooks, manifests, skills contracts, install-shape, installer Docker E2E, brainstorm-server Node tests) run via the `just` surface; the LLM-driven suites (claude-code, explicit-skill-requests, skill-triggering, subagent-driven-dev) are deprecated in place — see `tests/*/DEPRECATED.md`.
- `scripts/` — `bump-version.sh` (sync version across 9 files), `check-skill-count.sh` (guard: forbid hardcoded skill counts + structural self-consistency), `build-docs.sh`, `check-agent-bead-stamp.sh`, `check-zh-docs.sh`, `check-convention-sync.sh` (verify shared convention blocks are byte-identical across skills).
- `install.sh` — curl installer with 3-tier fallback chain (plugin system → npx → tarball/git clone). SHA-256 checksum validation, atomic rollback via staging directory, lazy prerequisites. Auto-detects Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and 6 more CLIs (Cursor, Copilot, Droid, Antigravity, Kimi, Pi).
- `mkdocs.yml` + `main.py` + `mkdocs_hooks.py` — MkDocs Material site config, macros plugin, and i18n language-switcher hook.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Skills are pure Markdown** — No executable code in skills. Claude Code auto-discovers `skills/*/SKILL.md`. Platform-agnostic by design. (See: upstream superpowers architecture)
- **Prompt templates over standalone agent files** — Subagent prompts (`implementer-prompt.md`, `researcher-prompt.md`) live inside their skills. Only the orchestrator (`yegge.md`) is a standalone agent file. Prevents drift between skill and dispatch instructions. (See: ADR-0003)
- **`bd` replaces TodoWrite everywhere** — Every `TodoWrite` reference in upstream superpowers replaced with `bd` commands. Beads provides persistent cross-session memory that TodoWrite lacks.
- **Three-layer architecture for example workflow** — `CLAUDE.md` (behavioral principles + project context) + `agents/yegge.md` (orchestration — triage + skill routing) + prompt templates (subagent dispatch). Each layer has a distinct responsibility. (See: ADR-0003, ADR-0032)
- **MkDocs Material for docs site** — HashiCorp/Terraform-style sidebar, dark theme, Mermaid diagrams. Template variables via macros plugin avoid hardcoded counts. (See: ADR-0001)
- **Per-task worktree isolation for parallel SDD** — Independent plan tasks execute in parallel (max 5), each in its own `bd worktree`. Prevents merge conflicts between concurrent subagents. (See: ADR-0002)

## Common Gotchas

- **Embedded Dolt mode** — `.beads/metadata.json` `dolt_mode: embedded` runs the Dolt engine **in-process** (no separate sql-server). This does NOT disable sync: `bd dolt status/show/push/pull` all work and a remote is configured (`origin`, git+ssh). (Verified 2026-06-28: `bd dolt push` → "Push complete".) Genuine push failures are setup-specific (diverged history, GitHub push-protection if a token is in Dolt history) — see the `project-init` skill, not a blanket "embedded fails".
- **`export.git-add` pollutes branches (v1.0.2 and earlier)** — In beads v1.0.2 and earlier, `export.git-add` defaulted to `true`, auto-staging `issues.jsonl` on every commit. Workaround: `bd config set export.git-add false` before branch work. In **v1.0.4+**, auto-export is opt-in by default — no workaround needed. Check with `bd config show`.
- **DCI only works in SKILL.md** — The `!` backtick syntax (Dynamic Context Injection) only works in `SKILL.md` and `.claude/commands/*.md`. NOT in agent `.md` files, `CLAUDE.md`, or rules files.
- **Never run `npx skills add` from inside this repo** — It replaces real skill files in `skills/` with symlinks to `.agents/skills/`, destroying the source. Use `-g` flag from `/tmp` or another directory.
- **Never chain `open` after `bd` commands** — `open <file>` hangs when chained in the same Bash invocation with `bd` commands. Always run `open` as a standalone call.
- **Worktree path default** — `bd worktree create <name>` creates at `./<name>` (sibling to repo files), NOT `.worktrees/<name>`. Pass the full path: `bd worktree create .worktrees/<name>`.
- **Worktree detection** — Use `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree`, NOT `[ -d .git ]`. In a worktree, `.git` is a file, not a directory.
- **Plugin cache goes stale** — After modifying skills, the installed plugin cache is outdated. Symlink the cache to this repo (see "Syncing Source" section below). `claude plugin update` has a [cache bug](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14061).
- **Skill `description` field trap** — Putting workflow descriptions in skill `description` frontmatter causes Claude to follow the description instead of reading the full skill body (SDO problem). Descriptions should state trigger conditions only.

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging:

```bash
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

```

**Important:** Claude Code auto-discovers `skills/`, `agents/`, and `hooks/` directories by convention. Do NOT declare these paths in `plugin.json` — it causes validation failures.

## Beads Integration

This plugin uses `bd` (beads) for ALL task tracking.

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — never TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODOs
- Only the orchestrating agent manages beads — subagents do NOT touch beads
- Include bead IDs in commit messages: `git commit -m "Add feature (bd-a1b2)"`
- Every session ends with Land the Plane: `bd close` → `bd dolt push` → `git push`

1. **Do NOT remove** anti-rationalization tables, Iron Laws, or Red Flags sections
2. **Do NOT add** TodoWrite references — use `bd` commands
3. Verify after changes: run `bash scripts/check-todowrite.sh` — must report "No active TodoWrite references"

### Key Anti-Patterns

- Putting workflow descriptions in skill `description` fields (causes Claude to follow description instead of reading full skill — see SDO in docs/methodology.md)
- Softening bright-line rules ("consider" instead of "MUST")
- Adding platform-specific code to skills (skills are pure Markdown)

## Build & Test

Skills are plain Markdown. The docs site uses MkDocs Material.

### Validation — the `just` surface (tool, not gate)

Run `just check` after touching harness plumbing (hooks/, install.sh, manifests, opencode/).
Pre-commit covers commit-time hygiene; nothing here is CI-enforced by design.

```bash
just            # = just check: guards + hooks + manifests + contracts + shape
just guards     # all guard scripts (todowrite, bead-stamp, zh-docs, convention-sync,
                #   skill-count + KNOWN_SKILLS drift, version sync, frontmatter)
just hooks      # tests/hooks/* (node tests SKIP visibly if node absent)
just shape      # install-shape: 9 harnesses (Tier A full artifacts; Tier B hint+manifest)
just shape codex  # one harness
just selftest   # guard-the-guards: 4 mutations that must fail
just server     # brainstorm-server Node tests (opt-in)
just docker     # installer Docker E2E (opt-in, slow)
just docs       # mkdocs build --strict (opt-in; needs the deploy-docs.yml pip set incl.
                #   mkdocs-panzoom-plugin + mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin)
```

```bash
# Verify beads integration (should be 30+)
grep -r "bd create\|bd close\|bd ready" skills/ | wc -l
```

For a quick, no-Docker installer smoke test outside the `just` surface: `bash install.sh --test`
(installs to `/tmp`, verifies, cleans up).

Skill *behavior* testing (the 4 LLM suites under tests/) is deprecated in place —
successor: the external eval-harness project. See tests/*/DEPRECATED.md.

**Release process (no GHA):** `./scripts/bump-version.sh <ver>` → update CHANGELOG →
tag `v<ver>` → `git push --tags`. Docs deploy stays manual via `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` (workflow_dispatch).

### Running Skill Tests

Deprecated in place (see "Validation" above) — skill *behavior* measurement now lives in the
external eval-harness project. Each suite's `DEPRECATED.md` explains why it was pulled out of `just check`.

## Version Management

Version is declared in 9 files that must stay in sync:

- `package.json`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `opencode/package.json`
- `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`
- `gemini-extension.json`
- `.kimi-plugin/plugin.json`

Use `scripts/bump-version.sh` to update all at once:

```bash
./scripts/bump-version.sh 0.5.3        # Bump to new version
./scripts/bump-version.sh --check      # Detect version drift
```

## Example Workflow

The `example-workflow/` directory provides a ready-to-use development workflow:

| File              | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CLAUDE.md`       | Karpathy's 4 behavioral principles + beads integration (generic template for any project)                                                                                            |
| `agents/yegge.md` | Orchestrator agent — lean router: triage table, full-flow routing, always-true rules, session protocol. Named after Steve Yegge (beads creator). Installed globally by `install.sh`. |

## Upstream Sources

| Source                                                    | Version           | What We Track                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)   | v6.0.3 (baseline) | Skill content, new skills, hook changes     |
| [gastownhall/beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) | v1.0.5 (baseline) | CLI commands, new features, bd prime format |

Use the `auditing-upstream-drift` skill to check for staleness.
