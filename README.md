---

A plugin for Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, and 6 more AI coding agents that makes your agent write tests before code, debug systematically instead of guessing, and remember what it worked on yesterday. Composable skills enforce the practices; a Dolt-backed issue tracker keeps context across sessions.

## How it works

When you start a task, the agent runs **brainstorming** to nail down requirements before touching code, then **writing-plans** to break the work into `bd`-tracked steps that survive session restarts. During implementation it follows **test-driven-development** (failing test first, always) and can fan out to parallel subagents via **subagent-driven-development** — each agent working in its own git worktree. `bd` stores every task, decision, and note in a local Dolt database, so the agent picks up exactly where it left off next session without relying on chat history.

Underneath all of it is a production-grade standard: the agent treats every task as if real users depend on it, so it won't quietly cut a corner, drop a requirement, or weaken a security control to move faster.

## What's Inside

## Docs

**[the-inconvenience-store.github.io/superbeads](https://the-inconvenience-store.github.io/superbeads/)** — getting started, methodology, skills reference, example workflow, and tips.

## Quickstart

The fastest path — Claude Code with native plugin install:

```bash
brew install beads                    # 1. Install bd (requires beads v1.1.0+)
# From your shell:
claude plugin marketplace add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
claude plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace
# Or, inside a Claude Code session:
# /plugin marketplace add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
# /plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace
# Then in your project directory:
bd init                               # 2. Bootstrap the Dolt database for this project
```

Start a new Claude Code session and type "where are we" — the agent will load your `bd` context and pick up where you left off.

Using a different agent? See [Installation](#installation) for native install on Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, Antigravity, Factory Droid, and Pi.

## Prerequisites

**Install `bd` before the plugin.** Its hooks call `bd` on every session start; without it they fail silently and you lose persistent memory. The Quickstart above uses Homebrew, or `npm install -g @beads/bd` on any platform. Verify with `bd version`.

**Note:** Native plugin install (Tier 1) installs skills and hooks, but not `bd init` — run that yourself per project.

## Installation

> **⚠️ Coexistence warning:** Do not install alongside [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers). Skill names collide — pick one or the other.

### Tier 1 — Verified

These paths are tested end-to-end. Prefer them.

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
claude plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace
```

Or as slash commands inside a Claude Code session: `/plugin marketplace add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads` then `/plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace`.

#### Codex CLI

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
codex plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace
```

After installing, enable hooks in `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[features]
codex_hooks = true
```

To get the SessionStart hook under Codex, use the scripted installer (`install.sh`) rather than the plugin channel — the plugin channel installs the skills but does not wire the hook.

#### OpenCode

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-inconvenience-store/superbeads/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer detects OpenCode and copies skills to `~/.config/opencode/skills/` and the TypeScript plugin to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` (active automatically).

### Tier 2 — Best-effort

Config validated; not E2E-tested by us. Use with that in mind.

#### Cursor

```text
/add-plugin superbeads
```

Run this command inside Cursor Agent. Update via the Marketplace UI.

#### GitHub Copilot CLI

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
copilot plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace
```

Update:

```bash
copilot plugin update superbeads
```

Note: rides the Claude-plugin fallback (skills + session-start via the shared `hooks/hooks.json`), the same mechanism upstream ships; requires Copilot CLI v1.0.11+ for session-start context injection.

#### Kimi Code

```text
/plugins install https://github.com/the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
```

Run `/new` after install to start a fresh session with the plugin active.

#### Antigravity

```bash
agy plugin install https://github.com/the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
```

Note: reuses the Claude plugin manifest — the same mechanism upstream verified.

#### Factory Droid

```bash
droid plugin marketplace add https://github.com/the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
droid plugin install superbeads@superbeads-marketplace
```

Note: reuses the Claude plugin manifest — the same mechanism upstream verified.

#### Pi

```bash
pi install git:github.com/the-inconvenience-store/superbeads
```

#### Universal fallback (npx)

> **Updating from ≤0.8.2:** earlier versions registered a per-prompt reminder hook that no longer ships. If your `~/.claude/settings.json` still references `superpowers-reminder.sh`, back it up, then remove the entry:
>
> ```bash
> cp ~/.claude/settings.json ~/.claude/settings.json.bak
> python3 -c "import json,os;p=os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/settings.json');d=json.load(open(p));H=d.get('hooks',{});U=H.get('UserPromptSubmit',[]);[m.update({'hooks':[h for h in m.get('hooks',[]) if 'superpowers-reminder' not in h.get('command','')]}) for m in U];U=[m for m in U if m.get('hooks')];(H.update({'UserPromptSubmit':U}) if U else H.pop('UserPromptSubmit',None));json.dump(d,open(p,'w'),indent=2)"
> ```

Installs the skills only — no hooks. Skill activation relies on your harness's native skill discovery.

```bash
npx skills add the-inconvenience-store/superbeads -g --copy -y
```

For the full experience (session-start injection of skill context + a composed beads context), use the plugin install (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode above) or the install script. To get beads context on an npx install, run `bd setup claude` (beads' own hook installer).

### Alternative: scripted install (`curl | bash`)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/the-inconvenience-store/superbeads/main/install.sh | bash
```

The script's role is broader than just copying files. Use it when you need any of:

- **Beads/Dolt bootstrap** — auto-detects whether `bd` is installed and guides setup
- **Hook registration** — writes the SessionStart entry to settings.json (required when using the install-script path)
- **`yegge.md` orchestrator** — optional add-on: installed only when you pass `--with-yegge`. The flag forces the scripted tarball/git install tier (the plugin and npx tiers are skipped for that run), so it can't be combined with a plugin-managed install in one command
- **Version pinning** — `--version X.Y.Z` for reproducible CI installs
- **CI environments** — use `--yes --skip-checksum` for unattended runs

Supports: `--yes` (skip prompts), `--version X.Y.Z`, `--with-yegge`, `--dry-run`, `--skip-checksum`, `--uninstall`.
