# beads-superpowers

A plugin for AI coding agents with **{{ skill_count }}** skills that enforce development practices — TDD, systematic debugging, design-before-code, code review — and a persistent issue tracker that remembers context across sessions.

The skills come from [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) by Jesse Vincent; the tracker from [Beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) by Steve Yegge. This plugin wires them together so skills create and close issues as they run, and the tracker feeds context back into each new session.

**Verified** on Claude Code, Codex CLI, and OpenCode. **Best-effort** native support for Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Kimi Code, Antigravity, Factory Droid, and Pi. See [Getting Started](getting-started.md#supported-platforms) for install paths by platform.

**Current version:** v{{ version }} · {{ skill_count }} skills
