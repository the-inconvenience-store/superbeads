# check-convention-sync.sh — assert the verbatim cross-cutting convention blocks
# are byte-identical across every site that carries them. Free-form duplication
# rots (bd-6814 ADR-strip missed skills/; the TodoWrite gate drifted across 4
# sites), so each canonical block is matched by an ASCII signature slice via
# `grep -qF` at all its declared sites; any missing/divergent copy is DRIFT.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/check-convention-sync.sh            # verify all sites (exit 1 on drift)
#   scripts/check-convention-sync.sh --self-test # prove the detector catches a mutated block
#

# ASCII-only signature slices (no em-dash) so the patterns are shell/grep-safe.
